Construction Wand is a Minecraft plugin based on Paper that provides players with powerful wands,
allowing them to place or break multiple blocks at once, greatly improving building and excavation efficiency.

## Features

### Breaking Wand
- Break multiple blocks at once
- Area can only be formed by one type of block
